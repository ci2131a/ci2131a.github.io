The National Institute of Health (NIH) approved several designs that used 3D printers to construct headbands made of polylactic acid (PLA) and laser cutters to fabricate visors. Some designs include support parts to further the comfort and stability of the design. The NIH approved design that we chose consisted of a a simple PLA headband that can be printed in about an hour and a plastic visor that is easily attached.
